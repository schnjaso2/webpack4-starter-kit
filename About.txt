About and Contact 
Thanks for stopping by!  I like to think that I create compelling, meaningful, and cathartic content employed using a wide gamut of methods and means. Primarily, this website is focused on my photography as well as my experiments in cartography. I also enjoy creating (and listening to!) music.
